# Section 1 :Getting Started

## What are Software tests ?

- code that runs other code and makes assertions and checks

- tests are requirements/specification

## What is a Unit ?

- A Unit is the smallest piece of code possible that can be tested

- Unit can be a combination of other smaller units which can be tested together , not seperately 

- Method

- Class

- Module

## Types of Software Tests

- Unit

- Integration

- End to End(UIs)

#### Why we need automated Tests ?

- Piece of mind as a developer/tester

- Catch bugs early

- Unit tests impose high code quality(If a unit is too difficult to test , the code quality should be improved)

- Prevent endless manual tests

- Think Big : a TODO list doesnt need tests
