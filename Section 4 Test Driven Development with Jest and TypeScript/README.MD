Test Development

- Test Driven Development : great when extending an app or fixing bugs

Test Driven Development -the TDD Cycle 

- All the tests will first start in a red state(They dont have an implementation so they will be failing tests)

- Then we write the implementation so they will be passing(green)

- After we have the implementation we are free to change or add other logic
